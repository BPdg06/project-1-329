## Project Description

This project is to create my own porfolio website using the HTML and CSS. The website is going to include responsive design which can be adaptive to various screen sizes like mobile, table and desktop. Furthermore, the CSS GRID is going to be used in order to create a multi-column layout and Flexbox to effective visual appearance of the contents for the website.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Issues and Resolutions
**ISSUES** I spent too much time on cover content and navigation bar/hamburger bar with details. Furthermore, I start out with desktop first design and it took more time and struggle to go backwards to make the navigation bar responsive.
**RESOLUTION** I should have aim for the big picture first in order to manage the restricted time.
